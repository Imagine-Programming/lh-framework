{"name":"Lh-framework","tagline":"A framework of MX LH modules for networking, data processing, api integration and more.","body":"lh-framework\r\n============\r\n\r\nA framework of MX LH modules for networking, data processing, api integration and more.\r\n\r\nThe following modules are currently implemented:\r\n\r\nCrypto\r\n------\r\n* crypto.cipher.hide-mem (memory obfuscation)\r\n* crypto.util.isaac (pseudo-random number generator, cryptographic) \r\n* crypto.checksum.adler32 (Adler32 checksum)\r\n* crypto.checksum.crc32 (CRC32 using either a pre-calculated table or your own table)\r\n* crypto.checksum.crc64 (CRC64 using either a pre-calculated table or your own table)\r\n* crypto.hash.md5 (Fast MD5 module)\r\n* crypto.hash.md5_slow (Slower but smaller MD5 module)\r\n* crypto.hash.murmur-hash3 (MurmurHash3 algorithm)\r\n\r\nUtilities\r\n---------\r\n* util.rgba (RGB and RGBA calculations, working with hexadecimal colors and negation) \r\n* util.bit (32-bit calculations, such as shifts, logical ops, rotates, bounds and addition/subtractions) \r\n\r\nNetworking\r\n----------\r\n* networking.resolve (Resolve hostnames and IP addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6 supported)\r\n\r\nIMXLH Version\r\n-------------\r\nThis code requires **[Imagine MemoryEx LH Compiler 1.2] [1]** or any version greater than that.  \r\nAside from that, **[MemoryEx 2.2] [2]** or greater is required to be able to load the produced LH modules.\r\n\r\nCompile\r\n-------\r\nCompilation is easy, just run build.bat. When you want to add more modules to this framework,  \r\nsimply add each source to the makefile.lhm and make sure they build in build/lh-framework/lh/*.\r\n\r\nIf you don't do this, the updatemain tool will not generate an index of those modules and the  \r\nCRC32 fingerprint required in main.lh will be lost.\r\n\r\nCompile Memory Libraries\r\n------------------------\r\nThe LH framework comes with the source code for the used memory libraries, such as ISAAC and \r\nlibmd5. We have developed these libraries based on existing code, or solely based on the \r\npublished algorithm. All these sources fall under the MIT license, however are public \r\ndomain code.\r\n\r\nCompile these libraries using VC++ 2013.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.memoryex.net/imxlh.html        \"IMXLH\"\r\n  [2]: http://www.memoryex.net/mx.html        \"MX\"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
